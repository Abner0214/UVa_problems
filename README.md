# UVa Online Judge Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to problems found on the UVa Online Judge platform. The solutions are primarily written in C++ and Python and are organized by problem number. This collection is intended to serve as a reference and learning aid for individuals interested in competitive programming and algorithmic challenges.

## About UVa Online Judge

[UVa Online Judge](https://onlinejudge.org/) is an online platform that provides a vast collection of competitive programming problems. It allows users to submit solutions in various programming languages and receive immediate feedback on the correctness and efficiency of their solutions.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured by problem number. Each solution is placed in its respective directory, named the problem number.

## Usage

To use these solutions, navigate to the problem directory of interest and review the solution files. Each solution file is named according to the programming language used (`solution.cpp` for C++ solutions, `solution.py` for Python solutions, etc.).

## Disclaimer

These solutions are provided for educational purposes and to help others understand different approaches to solving problems. While you may use these solutions to learn and improve your problem-solving skills, I strongly discourage directly submitting these solutions to UVa Online Judge or any other competitive programming platform as your own work.
